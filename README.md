This code was organized and show off as a tool using the College Scorecard API for higher education research.

Using R with College Scorecard Data to create Peer Comparison Metrics
In this session, we will demonstrate how Xavier University is using College Scorecard data to build metrics 
to compare itself against its peers and institutions in the tri-state area (Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio) in 
the areas of enrollment and completions; tuition costs and student earnings; test scores and student acceptance 
and retention; and demographics. This session will be presented through the use of the R programming language for 
cleaning and organization of the data then through Tableau to model the results.
